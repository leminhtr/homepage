I am currently a first-year industrial (CIFRE) Ph.D. student in deep learning at [TDK InvenSense France](https://invensense.tdk.com/) and the [INRIA Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes) in the [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/research/) research team. In 2019, I graduated as an engineer in Computer Science &amp; Engineering specialized in [Data Mining &amp; Decision Support](https://www.utc.fr/en/courses-and-training/the-utc-engineering-diploma/computer-sciences-and-engineering-gi/specialty-decision-data-mining-gi-fdd.html) at the [Université de Technologie de Compiègne, France (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr/en.html) and also obtained the Double European Master degree [EMECIS](http://emecis.eu/en/) in Machine Learning &amp; Optimization between the UTC and the [Scuola Politecnica di Genova, Italy](https://scuolapolitecnica.unige.it/). During the last semester of my Master, I worked as a research engineer intern at InvenSense to get familiar with my Ph.D. subject. 

My work focuses on **bringing the power of neural networks to very constrained micro-embedded systems** [#TinyML](). My research interests include **general deep learning, model compression, tinyML, edge inference, autoML, NAS**...
My supervisors are Etienne de Foras, Sr. software engineer at InvenSense and [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/), researcher at the INRIA.

I am passionate about innovation, research, artificial intelligence, as well as software development in general.
I thrive in an environment where I can apply my skills and enthusiasm to future-oriented projects that can help move our society forward.
I have a deep interest to collaborate within rich multi-cultural settings.
