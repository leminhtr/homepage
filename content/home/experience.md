Preliminary research study for a CIFRE Ph.D. thesis supervised by Thibaut Arribe, Ph.D. [@Kelis](https://scenari.kelis.fr/index.html) and [Stéphane Crozat](https://stph.crzt.fr/co/stph.html), research professor @Université de Technologie de Compiègne.
<br> The goal was to propose and research what *states* (e.g. test average, variance, behaviors, hesitations...) could be recover from a large database of singular *events*, to design a learning dashboard for professors to help identifying first-year students difficulties in STEM for [Faq2sciences website](https://www.faq2sciences.fr/) in a [Scenari](https://scenari.org/) context. An *event* can be switching an answer, validate, coming back to previous questions... and contains a set of JSON attributes (e.g. timestamp, event nature, clicks, quizz values...) and may be noisy.
<br>
Objectives included:
- Analyzed data (test results, answering time) using ElasticSearch to understand student progress and behavior (≈75.000 quiz samples)
- Designed a learning dashboard from the analysis with Kibana and then Plotly, intended for an integration to Faq2sciences website.
